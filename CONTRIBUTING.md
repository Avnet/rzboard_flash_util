## How to contribute to RZBoard Flash Utility

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Avnet/rzboard_flash_util/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Avnet/rzboard_flash_util/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible (**logs**), and comments reflecting the **expected behavior** that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the **problem** and **solution**. Include the relevant **issue number** if applicable.

* If the bugfix is simply a patch to support a new VLP, a new branch will likely be created.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) handles all formatting.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/Avnet/rzboard_flash_util/issues/new) discussing the feature request.
